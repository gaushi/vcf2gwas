## About The Project

Performing a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a dataset can be a laborious task, especially when analysing multiple phenotypes. VCF and input files have to be processed and prepared in the right way depending on the way the analysis is performed and afterwards various operations need to be carried out.

vcf2gwas is a Python-built API for GEMMA, PLINK and bcftools performing GWAS directly from a VCF file as well as multiple post-analysis operations.  
Some of the benefits of this pipeline include:

* VCF file does not need to be converted or edited by the user
* Input files will be adjusted, filtered and formatted for GEMMA
* GEMMA analysis will be carried out automatically (both GEMMA's linear (mixed) models and bayesian sparse linear mixed model available)
* Dimension reduction via PCA or UMAP can be performed on phenotypes and used for analysis.
* Once the analysis has been executed, the results will be analyzed:
    * Manhattan plots, QQ-plots and diagnostic plots (dependent on GEMMA's model)
    * Summaries of the SNPs 
    * Comparison to desired genes
* vcf2gwas is able to analyze several input files with different sets of individuals and multiple phenotypes in a efficient manner due to parallelization, saving the user a lot of time compared to standard GWAS procedure
* Results are reproducible on any compatible machine
* Figures are publication-ready

### Built with

vcf2gwas was built using [Python](https://www.python.org/), [bcftools](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html), [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/) and [GEMMA](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA).  

[GEMMA](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA) is the software implementing the Genome-wide Efficient Mixed Model Association algorithm for a standard linear mixed model and some of its close relatives for GWAS. It fits either a [univariate linear mixed model](https://doi.org/10.1038/ng.2310), a [multivariate linear mixed model](https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.2848) or a [Bayesian sparse linear mixed model](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1003264).

The exact versions of [Python](https://www.python.org/), [bcftools](http://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html), [PLINK](https://www.cog-genomics.org/plink/) and [GEMMA](https://github.com/genetics-statistics/GEMMA) used to build the pipeline are available in the [environment](https://github.com/frankvogt/vcf2gwas/blob/main/vcf2gwas/environment.yml) file.

## Getting Started

These instructions will provide an easy way to get vcf2gwas running on your local machine.  
vcf2gwas works on macOS and Linux systems.

### Prerequisites

The only requirement is an up to date version of [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) installed on your machine.

### Installation

It is good practice to install the package in a clean environment.  
So first create a new environment, here with the exemplary name 'myenv':

```
conda create -n myenv
```

Next, activate the environment by typing:

```
conda activate myenv
```

Now, the vcf2gwas package can be installed:

```
conda install vcf2gwas -c fvogt257 -c bioconda -c conda-forge
```

Everything is ready for analysis now.  
Optionally, to test the installation and copy the example files to your current working directory, run:

```
vcf2gwas -v test
```

Once the analysis is completed, the environment can be deactivated:

```
conda deactivate
```

## Usage

The items below will explain the required format of the input files, the basic usage and available options as well as the structure of the output files.

### Input Files

There are multiple files that can be provided as input for vcf2gwas, below you can find an overview over these files.  
For more information about the example files provided with vcf2gwas, please refer to the [manual](https://github.com/frankvogt/vcf2gwas/blob/main/MANUAL.md).

#### VCF file:
A VCF file containing the SNP data of the individuals to be examined is required to run vcf2gwas. This file does not need to be altered in any way and can be in either `.vcf` or `.vcf.gz` format.

#### Phenotype file(s):
One or multiple phenotype files can be used to provide the phenotype data for GEMMA. These files need to be in the comma separated `.csv` format.  
In the first column one has to put the IDs of the individuals. These IDs must match the individuals' IDs of the VCF file, since mismatched IDs will be removed from analysis.  The remaining columns resemble the phenotypes with the phenotype description as the column name. vcf2gwas will recognize either "-9" or "NA" as missing values and the phenotypes can be either continuous or binary.  
Example files to run GEMMA can be found in the input folder (VCF file + corresponding phenotype file with one phenotype). Below is an excerpt of the exemplary phenotype file `example.csv`:

||avrRpm|
|---|---|
|5837|1|
|6009|1|
|6898|1|
|6900|0|
|6901|0|

#### Covariate file:
A covariate file can be used to provide covariates for GEMMA analysis when running the linear mixed model. When running any other model, the contained covariates will be added as phenotypes for the analysis.  
The covariate file has to be formatted in the same way as the phenotype file, with individual IDs in the first column and the covariates in the remaining columns with their respective names as column names.

#### Gene file:
To compare the resulsts of the GWAS analysis with desired genes, a gene file can be provided as input. The gene file has to be in the comma separated `.csv` format as well with at least three columns containing information about chromosome, gene start position and gene stop position. These columns need to be named 'chr', 'start' and 'stop'.  
Furthermore it is necessary that the chromosome information is in the same format as the chromosome information in the VCF file, otherwise vcf2gwas won't recognize the information correctly.  
Optional columns providing additional information have to be called 'ID', 'name' and 'comment'. Below is an excerpt of an exemplary gene file:

|chr|start|stop|ID|name|comment|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|3644420|3647768|AT1G10920.1|LOV1||
|1|4144935|4147817|AT1G12220.1|RPS5|Disease resistance protein family|
|5|17462611|17467448|AT5G43470.1|RPP8|Disease resistance protein family|

#### Relatedness matrix:

To perform GWAS, GEMMA needs a relatedness matrix, which vcf2gwas will calculate by default. Nonetheless one can provide a relatedness matrix manually.

### Running vcf2gwas

Once the virtual environment is activated, vcf2gwas can be run on the command-line by specifying the input files and the statistical model chosen for GEMMA. Below is an exemplary command for running a linear mixed model analysis on all phenotypes in `example.csv` using genotype information from `example.vcf.gz`, both in the [input](https://github.com/frankvogt/vcf2gwas/tree/main/vcf2gwas/input) directory.  
This command can also be run to confirm the installation.

```
vcf2gwas -v example.vcf.gz -pf example.csv -ap -lmm
```

The available options will be elucidated in the next section.
